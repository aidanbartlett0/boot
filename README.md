Mock Command and Control Center where I (the attacker) can effectively export env variables from your device. Please note that this is not a realistic exfiltration of data since the account used in the demo (aidanbartlett0) owns this repo and is therefore able to push new updates directly to it. In real life, this repo wouldn't exist, and the updated code would simply grab your env variables and send them through an API to a real Command and Control Center.
